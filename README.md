# monophonic-music-transcription

## Brief

Repository for Senior Design Project. For this project, I worked on a team of three to develop a monophonic music transcription device, dubbed SheetSavvy. The device listens to input from an external electric piano, detects the notes in real time, and generates readable sheet music as pdf and xml files.
